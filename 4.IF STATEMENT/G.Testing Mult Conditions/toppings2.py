# The if-elif-else chain is powerful, but it’s only appropriate to use when you
# just need one test to pass
#  As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it
# skips the rest of the tests
# This behavior is beneficial, because it’s efficient
# and allows you to test for one specific condition

# However, sometimes it’s important to check all o the conditions of
# interest.

# In this case, you should use a series of simple if statements with no
# elif or else blocks

print("\n")

# This code would not work properly if we used an if-elif-else block,
# because the code would stop running after only one test passes
