# Using break to Exit a Loop

# To exit a while loop immediately without running any remaining code in the
# loop, regardless of the results of any conditional test, use the break statement.
# The break statement directs the flow of your program; you can use it
# to control which lines of code are executed and which arenâ€™t, so the program only
# executes code that you want it to, when you want it to
